Contributing to TBCNODE
===========================

Thank you for your interest.

At this stage in the development of TBCNODE, we welcome feedback and improvement suggestions from anyone 
through the "Issues" section of this repository. However, any security vulnerabilities or incompatibility proposals 
related to current or historical versions of the node software should be sent privately to the project 
email address (tbcnode@gmail.com) including the "**TBCNODE**" in the subject line.

We expect to improve this policy once the project achieves wider adoption.
